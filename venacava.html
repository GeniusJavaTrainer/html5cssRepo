    <p>Together, your superior vena cava and inferior vena cava collect deoxygenated blood from your whole body and bring it back to your heart for new oxygen. This is why the vena cava veins are the largest veins in your body. Your upper body veins send blood to your superior vena cava and your lower body veins empty blood into your inferior vena cava.</p>
